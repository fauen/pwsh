    .SYNOPSIS
    Easy way to check the current and upcoming weather.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The main idea if this function is to use the service wttr.in by Igor Chubin (https://github.com/chubin).
    There are multiple ways of using the service but in this case we focus on forecast and a small version of wttr.in.
    It's using the metric system not freedom units.

    .PARAMETER City
    -City is used to specify a specific city like Stockholm or NYC.
     
    .PARAMETER Small
    -Small will display a really small version of the current weather.

    .LINK
    Service used: https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-Weather
    This will grab your current location and show the forecast for it.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-Weather -City Stockholm
    This will show you the forecast for the city Stockholm.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-Weather -Small
    This will show the current weather at your location. No forecast.
